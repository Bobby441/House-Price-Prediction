# House-Price-Prediction

# Data Loading and Exploration:

Loads the training and testing datasets from CSV files ('train.csv' and 'test.csv') into Pandas DataFrames.
Displays the column names and basic statistics of the training dataset.
Creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'LotFrontage' feature.

# Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values in the dataset by filling them with appropriate values. Numerical missing values are imputed with the median, while categorical missing values are imputed with the mode (most frequent category).
Demonstrates the preprocessing steps for both numerical and categorical columns.

# Data Visualization:

Explores the distribution of the target variable ('SalePrice') using a histogram.
Creates a correlation heatmap to visualize the relationships between numerical features and identifies categorical columns for one-hot encoding.
Illustrates feature engineering by creating a new feature 'TotalSF' as the sum of '1stFlrSF' and '2ndFlrSF'.

# Model Building and Evaluation:

Splits the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Further divides the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) for model evaluation.
Constructs a Linear Regression model, trains it on the training data, and makes predictions on the testing data.
Evaluates the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R2).

# Future Usage:

This script serves as a foundational example of a regression analysis and machine learning project for predicting house sale prices. Its future usage and applications include:

## Model Improvement: 
Users can explore and implement more advanced regression models such as Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, or Neural Networks to potentially improve prediction accuracy.

## Feature Engineering: 
The script demonstrates a basic feature engineering step by creating the 'TotalSF' feature. Users can further experiment with feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Implementing hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search can help optimize model performance.

## Deployment: 
Once a satisfactory model is trained, it can be deployed as part of a real-world application for predicting house sale prices.

## Documentation: 
The script can be documented and included in data science or machine learning project portfolios to showcase data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation skills.

## Benchmarking: 
Users can use this script as a benchmark for evaluating other regression models on housing price prediction tasks.

In summary, this script provides a starting point for house price prediction projects and can be extended, improved, and customized to fit specific data science and machine learning requirements.
